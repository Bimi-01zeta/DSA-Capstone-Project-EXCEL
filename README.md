# DSA-Capstone-Project-EXCEL
This project has to do with analyzing and visualizing  amazon product review analysis data.
# Case Study 1: Amazon Product Review Analysis
## Overview
 Working as a Junior Data Analyst at RetailTech Insights, a company that helps e-commerce sellers on platforms like Amazon. I'm expected  to analyze product and customer review data to uncover insights that can guide product improvements, marketing, and customer engagement strategies.
 ## Analysis Tasks
I calculated average discounts, review counts, and ratings by category, Identify top-rated products, determined the distribution of ratings and price brackets, analyzed correlations like discount vs. rating, estimated potential revenue per product, identified categories with the most discounts or best performance.
## Methods used
Load the raw dataset into Excel. Review columns like product name, category, rating, prices, discount, and review count. Remove rows with missing values in key columns (e.g., price, rating). Convert data types to numeric values for prices, discounts, ratings. Standardize categories and fix inconsistent labels. Remove duplicates and blanks.
## Calculate
Discount %: (Actual Price – Discounted Price) / Actual Price.	Potential Revenue: Actual Price × Review Count. Rating × Review Count as a weighted score. Price Buckets: categorize products into price ranges.
I used pivot tables and charts to explore: Average discount by category, Rating distribution, Review count and product volume by category, Top-performing products, Correlation between discount and rating.
Visualize key metrics using charts (Bar, pie, column, scatter, and KPI cards), Add interactivity using slicers (e.g., category, price bucket).
